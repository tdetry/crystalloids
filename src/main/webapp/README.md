## Why?

To learn more about pros and cons of using vanilla JS in your apps. Before even touching Ember, Angular, React or any other frameworks - just learn the basics. No npms, grunts, gulps, webpacks, live-servers, hot or cold reloading - amazing tools but not for "JavaScript 101" class.

After more than three years of building JS apps I've thought about back to the basics - let's build 20min app without any package managers, frameworks, one- or two-way binding and all this cool stuf, and let's write a blog post about it. Awesome exercise!

## What's inside
